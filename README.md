Welcome to my personal website!

Hello there! My name is Benjamin and this website is a result of my hard work for a school assignment in 
the COMP SOEN 287 Web Development course. I am excited to share with you the skills I have acquired and 
the projects I have completed throughout my time at Concordia University.

Best regards,
Benjamin
